# Welcome to UK Pension Planner

## Why I Built This App

As a father, I found myself having the same conversation with my children over and over: *"You really should start saving for retirement now."* The response was always the same glazed-over look, followed by *"But that's decades away..."*

The problem wasn't that they didn't care about their future—it was that retirement planning felt abstract, complicated, and frankly, boring. Pensions? ISAs? LISAs? Tax relief? Crystallisation? It might as well have been a foreign language.

So I built this app. Not as a financial product, but as a **conversation starter**—a way to make the numbers real and show what happens when you start saving early versus waiting "just a few more years."

## The Power of Starting Early

Here's the thing about compound growth that's hard to grasp until you see it:

**£200/month starting at age 25** could grow to approximately **£500,000** by age 65 (assuming 5% growth).

**£200/month starting at age 35** might only reach approximately **£250,000** by age 65.

Same monthly amount. Same retirement age. **Half the result**—just because of a 10-year delay.

This app lets you play with these numbers yourself. Change the assumptions. See what happens. Make it real.

## What This App Helps You Explore

### The Savings Vehicles

**Workplace Pension**
- Your employer *must* contribute (currently at least 3% of qualifying earnings)
- You get tax relief on your contributions (20%, 40%, or 45% depending on your tax bracket)
- A higher-rate taxpayer putting in £80 actually gets £100 in their pension, plus £20 back via tax return
- It's literally free money that too many people ignore

**ISA (Individual Savings Account)**
- Tax-free growth and withdrawals
- £20,000 annual limit
- Flexible access—your money isn't locked away
- No tax on dividends, interest, or capital gains

**LISA (Lifetime ISA)**
- 25% government bonus on contributions (up to £1,000 free per year)
- Must be opened before age 40
- Can be used for first home purchase OR retirement (accessible from age 60)
- £4,000 annual limit (counts towards ISA allowance)
- Penalties for early withdrawal (except for first home)

### The Big Questions

This app helps you explore questions like:

- *"How much do I need to save each month to retire comfortably?"*
- *"What difference does starting 5 years earlier actually make?"*
- *"Should I prioritise pension or ISA?"*
- *"How long will my money last in retirement?"*
- *"What's the most tax-efficient way to draw down my savings?"*

## Demystifying Retirement Planning

Retirement planning doesn't have to be complicated. At its core, it's about answering three questions:

1. **How much will I need?** (Your future expenses)
2. **How much will I have?** (Your savings + growth + state pension)
3. **How do I bridge any gap?** (Save more, work longer, spend less)

Everything else—the tax strategies, the crystallisation options, the drawdown orders—these are optimisations. Important ones, yes, but don't let them overwhelm the basics.

### The Building Blocks

| What You Have | How It Helps |
|---------------|--------------|
| **State Pension** | Foundation—currently ~£12,500/year, inflation-protected |
| **Workplace Pension** | Tax-advantaged, employer contributions, long-term growth |
| **Private Pension (SIPP)** | More control, same tax benefits as workplace pension |
| **ISA** | Flexible, tax-free, accessible anytime |
| **LISA** | Government bonus, great for first home or retirement |
| **DB Pension** | Guaranteed income (if you're lucky enough to have one) |

### The Levers You Can Pull

- **Save more** — Even small increases compound significantly
- **Start earlier** — Time is your greatest asset
- **Retire later** — Each year adds to savings AND reduces years of drawdown
- **Spend less in retirement** — Lower target = easier to achieve
- **Optimise tax** — Legal strategies to keep more of what's yours

## Important Disclaimers

### This Is Not Financial Advice

**I am not a financial adviser.** I'm a software developer and a father who wanted to help his children understand the importance of saving for retirement. This app is an educational tool, not a financial planning service.

The projections in this app are based on assumptions that may not reflect reality:
- Investment returns are not guaranteed
- Inflation rates change
- Tax rules change (frequently!)
- Your personal circumstances are unique
- Past performance does not predict future results

### The Variables Are Endless

Retirement planning involves countless variables:

- How long will you live? (No one knows)
- What will inflation average over 40 years? (Educated guess at best)
- What returns will markets deliver? (Historically 4-7% real, but with huge variation)
- Will tax rules change? (Almost certainly yes)
- What will your health be like? (Unpredictable)
- Will you want to work part-time? (Your future self may surprise you)
- Will you inherit money? Have to support family? (Life happens)

**This app cannot predict the future.** It can only show you scenarios based on assumptions you provide. The real value is in understanding how different choices affect outcomes—not in the specific numbers it produces.

### Always Seek Professional Advice

Before making significant financial decisions, **please consult a qualified financial adviser**. They can:

- Assess your complete financial picture
- Consider your specific tax situation
- Recommend products appropriate for your risk tolerance
- Provide regulated advice with consumer protections
- Help you avoid costly mistakes

A good financial adviser is worth their fee many times over. This app might help you have a more informed conversation with them, but it's no substitute for professional guidance.

## A Final Thought

The best time to start saving for retirement was 20 years ago. The second best time is today.

This app exists because I believe that understanding beats ignorance, that playing with numbers beats avoiding them, and that having conversations about money—even uncomfortable ones—leads to better outcomes.

I hope it helps you and your family the way building it helped mine.
